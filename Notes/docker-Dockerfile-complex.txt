Dockerfile Complex

When running a flask app you'd need to do the following: 

- Have python installed
- Use pip to install flask
- Run and execute the python application 
- Ensure you have port 5000 open

Dockerfile contents:
# Using python as a base image (be linux based with python / flask installed)
FROM python:3.7
# Within our container, create and set this as our work directory
WORKDIR /cool-flask-app
# Move our app.py into this location
COPY cool-app.py .
# Use pip to install flask
RUN pip install flask
# Expose doesn't 'do anything' but is documenting the port to open
EXPOSE 5000
# Final command is running the app
ENTRYPOINT python cool-app.py

docker build -t custom-flaskapp .

docker run -d -p 80:5000 --name flaskcontainer reeceqa/custom-flask

Enter /console at the end of your URL to access an interactive console running python. Will require a pin, can be accessed by looking through docker logs of container
