Docker is an open source containerisation tool that can be easily installed on Linux by curling a web hosted script

sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl -y
curl https://get.docker.com/ | sudo bash

Whatever curl outputs, plug it in to the bash (terminal shell)

sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami) -
as admin, modify the users, and add the current user (whoami) to the docker Group

sudo reboot - reboot our terminal(to ensure we can run docker commands without sudo)
