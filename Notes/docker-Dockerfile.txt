Dockerfile 

Dockerfiles are the templates for building Images, Dockerfiles allow us to create custom images which we can then publish or build containers from 

All images are built off of something, we use an existing image as a template

We start with the nginx image, and build off of it

Create a `Dockerfile` and add the following:

# All Dockerfiles start from a template
FROM nginx:latest

# Modify the default html in nginx stored in /usr/share/nginx/html
# When we are creating Dockerfiles, it is a series of command words and values
RUN echo "This is custom html :)" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html 

RUN echo "Container started!" 

docker build -t <name of image> <path to Dockerfile> (if in this location use .)
