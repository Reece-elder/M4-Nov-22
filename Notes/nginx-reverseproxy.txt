When we access nginx it is purely hosting a dummy website, we can configure what nginx hosts so we can make it useful

within the program files of nginx is a file called nginx.conf
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

clear - clears all text in the console

edit the nginx.conf with vim / nano
sudo vim nginx.conf
sudo nano nginx.conf

i to enter insert mode
esc to exit insert mode
:wq to quit out of vim
