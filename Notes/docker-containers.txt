Docker containers

Containers have an assigned image, name, ports, command etc. And will continiously run until stopped

Run nginx as a container we use the following command
`docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginxContainer nginx`
-d: detached, runs in background
-p: port publishing, <host port> : <container port>
--name: name of our container
<image>

`docker ps` - outputs all current containers
