Dockerignore

Dockerignore files work exactly the same as .gitignore, they allow us to EXPLICITLY deny tracking of files when using wildcards

Its more efficient to allow all and explicitly deny some, than explicitly allow the majority

`touch .dockerignore`

# This ignore password.txt
password.txt

# Ignore all Markdown files
*.md

# Make an exception for README
!README.md

# Ignore the creds folder and all content
creds

Build and run our image
docker build -t <name> .
docker run -d -p 81:5500 <image name>

Exec into container to check passwords
docker exec -it <container name> bash
