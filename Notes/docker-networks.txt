Docker Networks

Creating a container that runs nginx, and an nginx container that will proxy pass to it

Create our docker custom network
`docker network create app`
`docker network ls` -> Outputs all docker networks

Create an nginx container that hasn't got published ports (no way to access from host vm directly)

docker run -d --network app --name nginx-container nginx

Build our proxy pass container
docker build -t proxy-pass-abc .

Run our proxy pass docker container 
docker run -d -p 80:80 --network app --name proxy-pass proxy-pass-abc

When we curl localhost we are sent to the proxy pass which CAN access the container that has no port published

files for proxy-pass

nginx.conf
events {}
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            # We enter the NAME of the container in the network app
            proxy_pass http://nginx-container; 
        }
    }
} 

Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
